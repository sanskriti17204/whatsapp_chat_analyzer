# whatsapp_chat_analyzer

This project provides a comprehensive web-based tool for analyzing WhatsApp chat data. It allows users to gain insights into their chat conversations through various statistical and visual representations.

# Problem Statement
While WhatsApp is a primary communication tool for many, understanding communication patterns, key topics, and user engagement within large chat histories can be challenging without dedicated analytical tools. Manually sifting through thousands of messages to identify trends, popular words, or active periods is inefficient and often impractical.

This WhatsApp Chat Analyzer addresses this by offering an automated solution to process chat export files and present insightful statistics and visualizations, enabling users to explore their communication habits and group dynamics effectively.

# Features
Total Statistics: Provides an overview of key metrics such as total messages, total words, media shared, and links shared.

User-Specific and Overall Analysis: Allows users to filter the analysis to view statistics and insights for the entire chat or for individual participants.

Monthly Timeline: Visualizes message activity over months, allowing users to identify trends and peak communication periods.

Daily Timeline: Displays message frequency on a daily basis, offering granular insights into daily chat patterns.

Word Cloud Generation: Creates a word cloud from chat content, highlighting the most frequently used words.

Activity Map (Most Busy Day/Month): Identifies the busiest days of the week and months in terms of message volume.

Daily Activity Map (Graphs): Presents daily activity patterns through graphical representations, showing hourly or daily message distribution.

Most Busy Users: Ranks and displays the most active participants in a chat.

Most Common Words: Lists the most frequently occurring words, excluding common stop words.

Emoji Analysis: Analyzes and visualizes the most used emojis in the chat.

# Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language for data processing, analysis, and application logic.

Streamlit: A powerful open-source framework used to create the interactive web application and user interface.

PyCharm: The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for project development and debugging.

Heroku: The platform used for deploying the web application, making it accessible online.

# Future Improvements
Sentiment Analysis: Integrate natural language processing (NLP) models to analyze the sentiment of messages (positive, negative, neutral).

User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow users to save their analysis reports securely.

Support for Multiple Chat Formats: Extend compatibility to handle chat export formats from other messaging applications.
